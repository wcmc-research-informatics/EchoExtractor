   normal RVEF of 52%
   CONVENTIONAL AND COLOR FLOW DOPPLER IMAGING:
There was trace mitral regurgitation.  There was mild tricuspid
regurgitation with a peak right ventricular systolic pressure of 35 mmHg. 
No other stenoses or regurgitations were identified.1.  Normal systolic function with mild chamber enlargement.

Summary and Conclusions
-  Normal LV size and low normal function with normal wall motion. EF in the
      55% range. Left ventricular wall thickness was increased in a pattern of
      mild concentric hypertrophy.
-  Myxomatous mitral valve with significant anterior leaflet prolapse. There is
      atleast moderate to severe MR with a posterio-laterally directed jet.
      The chords are redundant. Nothing is clearly broken except for very very
      minor chord flipping in the LV. The LV and LA is not dilated.
-  Tricuspid regurgitation grade was 1+ on a scale of 0 to 4+. PA pressures are
      27+RA systolic and 6+RA diastolic. RA pressures are normal.
